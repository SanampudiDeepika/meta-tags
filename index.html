            <summary>Do you also teach any new technologies like AI,ML or Blockchain?</summary>
            <p>Nope. We cannot say so.

                They are new technologies.
                
                But the cold truth is those technologies don’t offer jobs for freshers.
                
                That’s why we are focusing on Full Stack Developer, which is a reliable way to land a lucrative IT job in top companies.
                
                Anyway, if you are seeking to learn new technologies, we are not for you. We’re interested in only enrolling people who want to become a Full Stack Developer.</p>

            <summary>If you are offering the job,can i pay the fullcourse fee after I get the job?</summary>
            <p>Nope. You cannot.

                For a very simple reason.
                
                We want your 100% dedication and commitment - 8 hours a day, 5 days a week-for 7 months.
                
                Unless, you pay money from your (or, maybe dad’s or mom’s!) pocket and make a financial commitment, we cannot expect that you will be dedicated to the training.
                
                You might show up for a few days. Disappear. Come back. Disappear.
                
                So nope! That’s not going to work for us.
                
                And we cannot be spending time with non-serious, non-committed students.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Hmm...I just completed a paid training program.Why should i spend my money again on a couse?</summary>
            <p>You probably shouldn’t!

                But if you are still searching for an IT job with handsome pay and promising career, then you can consider our course.
                
                As we said earlier, we will not leave our students like orphans after the course is completed. We are promising you a average 4 Lakhs paying IT job.
                
                However, take our program only if you are serious about becoming a well-paid full stack developer in top software companies. Else, be happy with whatever you are doing. God bless!</p>
